# TTYD-Key-Item-Tracker
A Poptracker pack that can track items and locations for the Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door Randomizer by jamesbrq, supporting use with Archipelago.

This pack supports multiple styles and layouts.

FYI: The OG Map currently does not support location tracking, but will come soon when the first official release comes out.
Please report anything strange to me on discord!
