# TTYD-Key-Item-Tracker
A Poptracker pack that can track items and locations for the Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door Randomizer by jamesbrq, supporting use with Archipelago.

This pack supports multiple styles and layouts.

FYI: The OG Map currently does not support location tracking, but will come soon when the first official release comes out.
Please report anything strange to me on discord!


This will require the Poptracker software to run. The download for it can be found at https://poptracker.github.io/
